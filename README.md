# SimpleWebApp
This repository utilizes the power of Git for efficient version control. With Git, we can easily track and manage changes to the website's codebase, ensuring a well-documented history of its development.

I initialized a new Git repository locally on your computer.
I created a simple web application with HTML and CSS files in your project directory.
I added the files to the staging area and made an initial commit to create the first snapshot of your project.
